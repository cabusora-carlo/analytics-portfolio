# ðŸ§® Scripted Modeling

This folder contains statistical and predictive models written in **R** and **Python**. These projects demonstrate coding-based analytics including regression modeling and spline analysis using Jupyter Notebooks and R scripts.

## Contents

- `regression_model.R`  
  A script written in R that applies multivariate linear regression to explore relationships between predictors and an outcome variables. Uses an API to scrub customer feedback and give written text structure for analysis.

- `spline_modeling_1.ipynb`  
  A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the use of spline functions to model non-linear relationships in data.

- `spline_modeling_2.ipynb`  
  A second notebook expanding on spline modeling techniques, including visualizations and interpretation of model performance.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Regression analysis
- Spline modeling
- R scripting and Python notebooks
- Code-based data exploration
- Non-linear modeling techniques
- External API application
